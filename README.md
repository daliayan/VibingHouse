# Vibing House || Ruby on Rails 

This Ruby on Rails project was a huge undertaking but it was worth the knowledge I learned during this phase. VibingHouse is an application where Users can create their own customized houses and houserooms.

## Description of the Application

Vibing House is an application where Users can sign up / login / use Omniauth to login/signup with their Google Account. From there the User can create a customized house and add creative rooms to their house(s). The User can add many rooms to their houses, each customized with the houseroom join table. Users can see all the houses created, as well as a list of the most to least expensive houses.

## Installation

From there run the following command to ensure you have the required gems to run the application:
